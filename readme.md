# Stacks & Queues Exercises

This repository contains exercises for practicing stack and queue data structures.

## Getting Started

Download the starter code from the repository.

## Exercises

### Queues

Implement a Queue class. It should include methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, peeking, and checking if the queue is empty. Make it throw an error if you try to dequeue from an empty queue.

### Stacks

Implement a Stack class. It should include methods for pushing, popping, peeking, and checking if the stack is empty. Make it throw an error if you try to pop from an empty stack.

### Further Study: Composition

Re-implement your classes by using a LinkedList internally to manage the data structure. Then make a new version using an array instead of a linked list. Which do you prefer?

### Further Study Build: Deque

For extra practice with linked lists, build a deque using a doubly-linked list. Make sure it includes all of the expected methods for a deque.

## Challenges

For these challenges, use either a stack or a queue (or a combination of both!)

- Browser Back/Forward
- String Reversal
- Balanced Brackets?
- Josephus Survivor
- Calculator
