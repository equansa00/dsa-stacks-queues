# Data Structures and Algorithms: Stacks and Queues

This repository is dedicated to exercises and challenges involving stacks and queues, helping you master these essential data structures through practical implementation and problem-solving.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `src`: Contains the implementation of data structures and algorithms.
  - `algorithms`: Scripts for various algorithmic challenges.
  - `data_structures`: Implementation of fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- `tests`: Includes tests for each implementation to ensure correctness and stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project uses Node.js to run JavaScript code outside a browser.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stacks-queues.git
cd stacks-queues
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Tests

To ensure that the implementations work as expected, execute the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs all tests and outputs the results, verifying each data structure and algorithm.

## Exercises and Challenges

### Data Structures

- Stacks: Implement a stack with methods for push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. Ensure exceptions are handled, such as popping from an empty stack.
- Queues: Implement a queue with methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty. Include error handling for dequeueing from an empty queue.
- Doubly Linked List: Enhance your understanding by implementing a doubly linked list, used in more complex structures like deques.

### Algorithmic Challenges

- Browser History Simulation: Utilize two stacks to simulate browser forward and back operations.
- String Reversal: Reverse a string using a stack to handle characters.
- Balanced Brackets: Check if brackets in a string are balanced using a stack.
- Josephus Problem: Solve the Josephus problem using a queue to determine the survivor's position.
- Polish Notation Calculator: Implement a calculator that uses stack operations to evaluate expressions in Polish notation.

## Further Enhancements

Experiment by reimplementing the stack and queue using a linked list and then an array. Evaluate which implementation you prefer in terms of performance and ease of use.
